  </p>
  <p>There are two players, called <em>Lords</em>. They live in the same world and fight for survival.
    Every Lord starts with one <em>settlement</em> on a <em>region</em>. The goal of a Lord is to control all the
    settlements in
    the world.</p>

  <p>A <em>domain</em> is a set of adjacent regions. A region could be <em>plain</em>, <em>water</em>,
    <em>forest</em>, <em>hill</em>, <em>mountain</em>, or
    <em>settlement</em>.</p>

  <p>A Lord harvest their domains at the beginning of their turn. Goods provide coins. Lords spend coins to expand
    their domain.</p>

  <p>Lords can <em>colonize</em>, <em>conquer</em>, <em>settle</em> and <em>fortify</em> regions. They can do
    these only on regions next to a
    domain containing at least a settlement. Lords can <em>rush</em>, too.</p>

  <h2>Terrains</h2>

  <h3>Plain</h3>
  <p>Standard terrain. Easiest to colonize and conquer, low in resources — food.</p>

  <h3>Water</h3>
  <p>Easy to colonize and conquer, low in resources — food. Lords can’t build settlements on water.</p>

  <h3>Forest</h3>
  <p>Some difficulty to colonize and conquer, medium resources — wood, food.</p>

  <h3>Hill</h3>
  <p>Some difficulty to colonize and conquer, low resources — food.</p>

  <h3>Mountain</h3>
  <p>Hard to colonize and conquer, rich in resources — wood, iron.</p>

  <h3>Settlement</h3>
  <p>Settlements are at the mercy of troops if invaded. They also give no resources. They have a maintenance cost —
    Lord's peasants live here.
    Every settlement and its people can sustain up to 100 regions. A Lord needs another settlement to conquer or
    colonize more regions.</p>

  <p>If a Lord loses all of their settlements, they lose the game.</p>

  <h2>Actions</h2>
  <h3>Harvesting</h3>
  <p>Harvesting happens at the beginning of each turn. The Lord's peasants collect their goods and transform them into
    coins.
    Every type of region has a different worth in coins. The amount collected is the sum of every region's worth.</p>

  <h3>Sustaining</h3>
  <p>Lords must sustain settlements and fortified regions. After the harvesting, Lords pay the sustenance costs.
    If they don't have enough coins, they must pay for settlements first, so they revoke every fortification.
    If they can't still pay for settlements, the peasants will revolt against the Lord and won't do anything more until
    the next turn.
    Harvesting happens before the sustenance payments, so it wont't affect the treasure.</p>

  <h3>Colonize</h3>
  <p>Every type of terrain has a different colonization cost. Lords can only colonize regions next to a domain
    containing at least a settlement.
    A colonized plot joins immediately the Lord's domain.
    Once colonized, a region is impregnable for one turn.</p>

  <h3>Conquer</h3>
  <p>Cost of conquer in a normal environment for regions is the colonization cost, double.
    Lords can only conquer enemy regions next to a domain containing at least a settlement.
    Once conquered, a region is impregnable for one turn.</p>

  <h3>Fortify</h3>
  <p>Lords can fortify every colonizable region in their domain — not settlements.
    Fortification doubles the cost of conquer for every enemy on that region.</p>

  <p>Its cost is equal to the cost of colonization for that region.
    Lords must sustain ongoing fortifications. they can revoke the fortifications, too.</p>

  <p>A Lord cannot fortify an already fortified region.</p>

  <h3>Settle</h3>
  <p>Lord can build a settlement on a region. They can only do it twice — they can still own more than three by conquer.
    When a Lord owns all the settlements on the map, they win the game.
    The region is no more colonizable and doesn’t farm. Lords must sustain settlements.</p>

  <h3>Rush</h3>
  <p>A Lord can rush whenever he wants in their turn, but only once per turn.</p>

  <p>Rush means that a Lord harvest more for that turn, but ignoring a correct seeding for the next one.
    Rush adds 20% of the harvest income for that turn, but also halves the income of the following Lord's turn.</p>
