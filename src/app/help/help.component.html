    <p>SEDL! is a turn based strategic game. You're a Lord and you rule over a settlement and some land in a virgin
      world. Other Lords are trying to stand out in this world. Your goal is to rule them all and their settlements.</p>

    <p>Your people live in your settlements. Settlements have a sustenance cost — your people need to eat. To sustain
      your settlements, you need to collect goods from your land.</p>

    <p>Your explorers have charted the world in regions. They have found five types of land: plain, hill, mountain,
      forest, and water. Each one has its advantages and weaknesses. See the table at the bottom to see the worth and
      the costs of all them.</p>

    <p>You start ruling over a settlement and its surrounding regions. This is your initial domain — a domain is a set
      of regions controlled by a settlement. Your people collect goods from your domain the the beginning of your turn.
      They convert them into coins for your treasury; then you pay your sustenance costs.</p>

      <figcaption>A domain is a set of regions controlled by a settlement.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Your domain is wide enough to sustain your settlement, but you won't go far with it. You need to expand your
      domain if you want to rule over the world. Use coins from your treasury to tame more regions.</p>

    <p class="help__hint" [seCurrentLordColor]="game.lord$ | async">Pinch the map to zoom in and out. Pan it to move
      along your domains.</p>

    <p>You tame a land by colonization or conquest. Colonize regions next to your domain when they don't belong to a
      Lord.</p>

      <img class="help__image" src="assets/colonize.png" alt="Domain expansion by colonization"/>

    <p>Conquer regions next to your domain when they do belong to another Lord.</p>

    <figure>
      <img class="help__image" src="assets/conquer.png" alt="Domain expansion by conquest"/>
      <figcaption>Conquering a region.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p> Each type of land has a colonization cost; conquering that region will cost you double. A tamed region enters
      your domain and is impregnable until your next turn. Your people will collect goods from the new region at the
      beginning of your next turn.</p>

    <p class="help__hint" [seCurrentLordColor]="game.lord$ | async">Tap a region next to your domain to conquer or
      colonize it.</p>

    <p>Remember that you need your people to collect goods from a region. If another Lord cut off some regions from your
      domain, your people won't be able to reach them. You won't collect goods from them as long as they don't belong to
      a domain. Those regions will recognize you as their Lord though: they won't resign.</p>

      <figcaption>People from the settlement can't reach the regions on the left.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>You can't stop other Lords from conquering your regions in their turn, but you can make the task harder. Fortify
      a region to double its conquest cost. Remember that you can't fortify water and settlements!
      Fortifications are great, but they have a cost — the same as the colonization cost. You must sustain this cost in
      every turn. When you don't need a fortification anymore, you can withdraw your forces from the region.
      Withdrawing won't cost anything. Your forces will withdraw from a fortified region if you lose control over
      it.</p>

    <p class="help__hint" [seCurrentLordColor]="game.lord$ | async">Tap a region in your domain to fortify it. Tap it
      again to withdraw your forces from there.</p>

    <p>If you can't pay for your fortifications at the beginning of your turn, all your forces will withdraw. Then you
      can fortify your regions again, based on your resources. If you still don't have enough money, then you can't
      sustain your settlements. Your people will get angry and won't work for you until the next turn.</p>

    <p>Sometimes you need more money to reach your goals. You can ask your people to rush — they will collect more goods
      in that turn, and add 20% of your worth to your treasury. But this is a perilous move — you will collect your
      money, but you will wear out your people. Your domain will need some rest, too. You will collect half your worth
      in the next turn, giving time to your domain and your people to rest.</p>

    <p>A settlement and its people can sustain up to 100 regions — what can you do to expand your domain further? Build
      another settlement! If you have more settlements in your domain, you won't fear other Lords cutting your domain in
      half. You can build up to two more settlements, but you can control more conquering them.</p>

    <p class="help__hint" [seCurrentLordColor]="game.lord$ | async">Press and hold a region in your domain to build a
      settlement.</p>

    <p>But pay attention! Even though a new settlement is impregnable until your next turn, they are very weak. If a
      Lord conquers a region next to a settlement, they can take the settlement too for free. And if the settlement is
      the only one in that domain, the Lord will win the whole domain too! To avoid this pitfall, try to keep more than
      one settlement in every domain. If a Lord conquers one of the settlements, the domain is still yours, as it's
      reachable from other settlements. When you lose control over all your settlements, you can't do anything and you
      lose.</p>

    <p>Time to rule the world, good luck and have fun!</p>
